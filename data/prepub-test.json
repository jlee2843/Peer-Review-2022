      "abstract": "Nuclear transport is an essential part of eukaryotic cell function. Several assays exist to measure the rate of this process, but not at the single-cell level. Here, we developed a fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)- based method to determine nuclear import and export rates independently in individual live cells. To overcome the inherent noise of single-cell measurements, we performed sequential FRAPs on the same cell. We found large cell-to-cell variation in transport rates within isogenic yeast populations. Our data suggest that a main determinant of this heterogeneity may be variability in the number of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). For passive transport, this component explained most of the variability. Actively transported proteins were influenced by variability in additional components, including general factors such as the Ran-GTP gradient as well as specific regulators of the export rate. By considering mother-daughter pairs, we showed that mitotic segregation of the transport machinery is too noisy to control cellular inheritance. Finally, we studied mother-daughter cell asymmetry in the localization of the transcription factor Ace2, which is specifically concentrated in daughter cell nuclei. We found that this asymmetry is the outcome of a higher ratio of import rate to export rate in daughters. Interestingly, rather than reduced export in the daughter cell, as previously hypothesized, rates of both import and export are faster in daughter cells than in mother cells, but the magnitude of increase is greater for import. These results shed light into cell-to-cell variation in cellular dynamics and its sources.",

      "abstract": "Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.\n\nHere, we developed methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A\/C\/G\/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We developed Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and enhanced the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) Suite by adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet.\n\nUsing these methods, we identified modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirmed established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C\/EBP{beta} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discovered novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validated predicted binding preferences of OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.",

      "abstract": "Alternative reproductive tactics and strategies (ARTS) refer to polymorphic reproductive behaviours in which in addition to the usual two sexes, there are one or more alternative morphs, usually male, that have evolved the ability to circumvent direct intra-sexual competition. Each morph has its own morphological, ecological, developmental, behavioural, life-history, and physiological profile that shifts the balance between reproduction and self-maintenance, one aspect being immunity. Immunoecological work on species with ARTS, which is the topic of this review, is particularly interesting because the alternative morphs make it possible to separate the effects of sex, per se, from other factors that in other species are inextricably linked with sex. We first summarize the evolution, development and maintenance of ARTS. We then review immunoecological hypotheses relevant to species with ARTS, dividing them into physiological, life-history, and ecological hypotheses. In context of these hypotheses, we critically review in detail all immunoecological studies we could find on species with ARTS. Several interesting patterns emerge. Oddly, there is a paucity of studies on insects, despite the many benefits that arise from working with insects: larger sample sizes, simple immune systems, and countless forms of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. Of all the hypotheses considered, the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis has generated the greatest amount of work, but not necessarily the greatest level of understanding. Unfortunately, it is often used as a general guiding principle rather than a source of explicitly articulated predictions. Other hypotheses are usually considered a posteriori, but it is perhaps time that they take centre stage. Whereas blanket concepts such as \"immunocompetence\" and \"androgens\" might useful to develop a rationale, predictions need to be far more explicitly articulated. Integration so far has been a one-way street, with ecologists delving deeper into physiology, seemingly at the cost of ignoring their organisms evolutionary history and ecology. One possible useful framework is to divide ecological and evolutionary factors affecting immunity into those that stimulate the immune system, and those that depress it. Finally, the contributions of genomics to ecology are being increasingly recognized, including in species with ARTS, but we must ensure that evolutionary and ecological hypotheses drive the effort, as there is no grandeur in the strict reductionist view of life.",

      "abstract": "Central Nervous System (CNS) organogenesis is a complex process that obeys precise architectural rules. The impact that nervous system architecture may have on its functionality remains, however, relatively unexplored. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the development of the Drosophila embryonic Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC). VNC morphogenesis requires the tight control of Jun kinase (JNK) signaling, exerted in part via a negative feedback loop mediated by the dual specificity phosphatase Puckered, in a subset of pioneer neurons. Here we show that the JNK pathway autonomously regulates neuronal electrophysiological properties without affecting synaptic vesicle transport. Manipulating, during early embryogenesis, JNK signaling activity in pioneer neurons, directly influences their function as  organizers of VNC architecture and, moreover, uncovers a role in the coordination of the embryonic motor circuitry that is required for hatching. Together, our data reveal critical links, mediated by the control of the JNK signaling cascade by Puckered, between the structural organization of the VNC and its functional optimization.",

      "abstract": "Predicting a multicellular organisms phenotype quantitatively from its genotype is challenging, as genetic effects must propagate across scales. Circadian clocks are intracellular regulators that control temporal gene expression patterns and hence metabolism, physiology and behaviour. Here we explain and predict canonical phenotypes of circadian timing in a multicellular, model organism. We used diverse metabolic and physiological data to combine and extend mathematical models of rhythmic gene expression, photoperiod-dependent flowering, elongation growth and starch metabolism within a Framework Model for the vegetative growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, sharing the model and data files in a structured, public resource. The calibrated model predicted the effect of altered circadian timing upon each particular phenotype in clock-mutant plants under standard laboratory conditions. Altered night-time metabolism of stored starch accounted for most of the decrease in whole-plant biomass, as previously proposed. Mobilisation of a secondary store of malate and fumarate was also mis-regulated, accounting for any remaining biomass defect. We test three candidate mechanisms for the accumulation of these organic acids. Our results link genotype through specific processes to higher-level phenotypes, formalising our understanding of a subtle, pleiotropic syndrome at the whole-organism level, and validating the systems approach to understand complex traits starting from intracellular circuits.\n\nThis work updates the first biorXiv version, February 2017, https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/105437, with an expanded description and additional analysis of the same core data sets and the same FMv2 model, summary tables and supporting, follow-on data from three further studies with further collaborators.

      "abstract": "In systems and synthetic biology, it is common to build chemical reaction network (CRN) models of biochemical circuits and networks. Although automation and other high-throughput techniques have led to an abundance of data enabling data-driven quantitative modeling and parameter estimation, the intense amount of simulation needed for these methods still frequently results in a computational bottleneck. Here we present bioscrape (Bio-circuit Stochastic Single-cell Reaction Analysis and Parameter Estimation) - a Python package for fast and flexible modeling and simulation of highly customizable chemical reaction networks. Specifically, bioscrape supports deterministic and stochastic simulations, which can incorporate delay, cell growth, and cell division. All functionalities - reaction models, simulation algorithms, cell growth models, partioning models, and Bayesian inference - are implemented as interfaces in an easily extensible and modular object-oriented framework. Models can be constructed via Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) or specified programmatically via a Python API. Simulation run times obtained with the package are comparable to those obtained using C code - this is particularly advantageous for computationally expensive applications such as Bayesian inference or simulation of cell lineages. We first show the packages simulation capabilities on a variety of example simulations of stochastic gene expression. We then further demonstrate the package by using it to do parameter inference on a model of integrase enzyme-mediated DNA recombination dynamics with experimental data. The bioscrape package is publicly available online (https:\/\/github.com\/biocircuits\/bioscrape) along with more detailed documentation and examples.",

      "abstract": "KAMO and Blend provide particularly effective tools to manage automatically the merging of large numbers of datasets from serial crystallography. The requirement for manual intervention in the process can be reduced by extending Blend to support additional clustering options such as use of more accurate cell distance metrics and use of reflection-intensity correlation coefficients to infer \"distances\" among sets of reflec- tions. This increases the sensitivity to differences in unit cell parameters and allows for clustering to assemble nearly complete datasets on the basis of intensity or ampli- tude differences. If datasets are already sufficiently complete to permit it, one applies KAMO once and clusters the data using intensities only. If starting from incomplete datasets, one applies KAMO twice, first using cell parameters. In this step we use either the simple cell vector distance of the original Blend, or we use the more sensi- tive NCDist. This step tends to find clusters of sufficient size so that, when merged, each cluster is sufficiently complete to allow reflection intensities or amplitudes to be compared. One then uses KAMO again using the correlation between the reflections having a common hkl to merge clusters in a way sensitive to structural differences that may not have perturbed the cell parameters sufficiently to make meaningful clusters.\n\nMany groups have developed effective clustering algorithms that use a measurable physical parameter from each diffraction still or wedge to cluster the data into cate- gories which then can be merged, one hopes, to yield the electron density from a single protein form. Since these physical parameters are often largely independent from one another, it should be possible to greatly improve the efficacy of data clustering software by using a multi-stage partitioning strategy. Here, we have demonstrated one possible approach to multi-stage data clustering. Our strategy is to use unit-cell clustering until merged data is sufficiently complete then to use intensity-based clustering. We have demonstrated that, using this strategy, we are able to accurately cluster datasets from crystals that have subtle differences.",

      "abstract": "There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.",

      "abstract": "The timescales of the dynamics of a system depend on the combination of the timescales of its components and of its transmission delays. Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\n\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.",

Participants responses used both memory and sensory information, in accordance to their relative reliability. Formal model comparison showed that the sensory inference was best explained when its parameters were set dynamically at each trial by evidence sampled from memory.

      "abstract": "Genetic contributions of Neanderthals to the modern human genome have been evidenced by comparative analyses of present-day human genomes and paleogenomes. Current data indicate that Neanderthal introgression is higher in Asians and Europeans and lower in African lines of descent. Neanderthal signatures in extant human genomes are attributed to intercrosses between Neanderthals and ancient Homo sapiens lineages, or archaic Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) that migrated from Africa into the Middle East and Europe in the last 50,000 years. It has been proposed however that there is no contribution of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA to contemporary human genomes. Here we show that the modern human mitochondrial genome might contains potential 66 Neanderthal signatures, or Neanderthal single nucleotide variants (N-SNVs) being 36 in coding regions (7 nonsynonymous), 5 in SSU rRNA, 4 in LSU rRNA, 3 in tRNAs and 18 in the D-loop. Also, 7 N-SNVs are associated with traits such as cycling vomiting syndrome and Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases and 2 N-SNVs associated with intelligence quotient. Based on our results with bootscan recombination tests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the complete absence of these N-SNVs in 41 archaic AMH mitogenomes recombination events cannot explain the presence of N-SNVs in present-day human mitogenomes. These results suggest that homoplasies alone and convergent evolution can explain N-SNVs. Our data also shows that African mtDNAs have Neanderthal SNVs as has been suggested for nuclear genome. Based on our data we conclude that most intercrosses might have occurred between Neanderthal males and archaic AMH females, crosses between archaic AMH males and Neanderthal females would be extremely rare and recombination was negligible, which explains the few Neanderthal marks (66 out of 16,569bp) in present day mitochondrial genomes of human populations. These 66 signatures are probably the result of homoplasies and convergent evolution.",

      "abstract": "The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\n\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.",

      "abstract": "Species declines and losses of biota are often associated with shifting baselines in perceived historical abundances, and\/or neglect or abandonment of recovery actions aimed at ecological restoration. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in the geographical distribution of the species, with associated negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we show using citizen science and other data that after 50-60 years of near total absence, the iconic top predator and highly migratory species bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, returned by the hundreds if not thousands in waters near Denmark, Norway and Sweden during August-October 2015-2017. The re-utilisation of this former habitat is part of a geographically more widespread expansion of the summer foraging area to the northern part of the northeast Atlantic Ocean, encompassing waters from east Greenland to west Sweden. The remarkable return to the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea has been facilitated by improved fishery management for bluefin tuna and its prey. Bluefin tuna biomass in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean has been increasing since a recovery plan was implemented in the late 2000s, and biomasses of two key prey species (herring, Clupea harengus; mackerel, Scomber scombrus) recovered during the late 1980s-1990s. The reappearance of bluefin tuna in the Skagerrak-Kattegat and other waters of northern Europe, despite a recent history of mismanagement and illegal fishing in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean which led to a critical population decline, offers hope that other marine ecological recoveries are possible under improved management of fisheries and ecosystems.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryImproved management promotes the return of an ocean icon to northern Europe.\n\nSignificance StatementCommercial fisheries are often perceived being in a state of decline and collapse, putting food and economic security at risk. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in stock distribution, negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we present an example based on one of the worlds most valuable and iconic fish species, bluefin tuna, which demonstrates that effective management of both bluefin tuna and its prey has been a key factor leading to a remarkable reoccupation of formerly lost habitat. This reappearance, following decades of absence, occurred despite the bluefin tuna stock having had a recent, long history of unsustainable and illegal exploitation. Marine ecological recovery actions can be successful, even in situations which may initially appear intractable.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is difficult to diagnose in early stages. Without homeostatic control, urine was reported to have the ability to accumulate early changes in the body. We expect that urinary proteome can reflect early changes in the nervous system. In this study, the early urinary proteome changes in a most employed multiple sclerosis rat model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)) were analyzed to explore early urinary candidate biomarkers, and early treatment of methylprednisolone were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Compare with controls, twenty-five urinary proteins were altered at day 7 when there were no clinical symptoms and no obvious histological changes. Among them, twenty-three have human homologs and fourteen were reported to be differently expressed in the serum\/cerebrospinal fluid\/brain tissues of multiple sclerosis patients or animal models. Functional analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins were associated with asparagine degradation, neuroinflammation and lipid metabolism. After the early treatment of methylprednisolone, the incidence of encephalomyelitis in the intervention group was only 1\/13. This study demonstrates that urine may be a good source of biomarkers for the early detection of multiple sclerosis and early treatment can significantly delay disease progression. These findings may provide important information for early diagnosis and intervention of multiple sclerosis in the future.",

      "abstract": "While performing challenging perceptual tasks such as detecting a barely visible target, our perceptual reports vary across presentations of identical stimuli. This perceptual variability is presumably caused by neural variability in our brains. How much of the neural variability that correlates with the perceptual variability is present in the primary visual cortex (V1), the first cortical processing stage of visual information? To address this question, we recorded neural population responses from V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging while monkeys performed a challenging reaction-time visual detection task. We found that V1 population responses in the period leading to the decision correspond more closely to the monkeys report than to the visual stimulus. These results, together with a simple computational model that allows one to quantify the captured choice-related variability, suggest that most of this variability is present in V1 as additive noise, and that areas downstream to V1 contain relatively little independent choice-related variability.",

We use a simple dynamical model of CRISPRi to show that it can be used to build repressilators, toggle switches, and incoherent feed-forward loops. We also show that the function some of these circuits are expected to be sensitive to several key parameters, and we provide specifications for those parameters. Our modeling reveals key engineering requirements and considerations for the construction of dynamic CRISPRi circuits, and provides a roadmap for building those circuits.",

      "abstract": "Computational models in systems biology and systems medicine are typically simulated using a single formalism such as ordinary differential equations (ODE). However, more complex models require the coupling of multiple formalisms since different biological phenomena are better described by different methods. For example, metabolism in steady state is often modeled using flux-balance analysis (FBA) whereas dynamic changes of model components are better described via ODEs. The coupling of FBA and ODE modeling formalisms results in dynamic FBA models. A major challenge is how to describe such hybrid models that couple multiple formalisms in a standardized way so that they can be exchanged between tools and simulated consistently in a reproducible manner. This paper presents a scheme for encoding and implementation of dynamic FBA models in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), thereby enabling the exchange of multi-framework computational models between software tools. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using various example models and show that different tools are able to simulate the hybrid models and agree on the results. As part of this work, two independent implementations of a multi-framework simulation method for dynamic FBA have been developed supporting such models: iBioSim and sbmiutils.",

      "abstract": "Humans and animals make predictions about the rewards they expect to receive in different situations. In formal models of behavior, these predictions are known as value representations, and they play two very different roles. Firstly, they drive choice: the expected values of available options are compared to one another, and the best option is selected. Secondly, they support learning: expected values are compared to rewards actually received, and future expectations are updated accordingly. Whether these different functions are mediated by different neural representations remains an open question. Here we employ a recently-developed multi-step task for rats that computationally separates learning from choosing. We investigate the role of value representations in the rodent orbitofrontal cortex, a key structure for value-based cognition. Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic perturbations indicate that these representations do not directly drive choice. Instead, they signal expected reward information to a learning process elsewhere in the brain that updates choice mechanisms.",

Thus, our data shows NK cell signal integration is critically dependent on the dimensions of NK cell ligand-receptor pairs by affecting their relative nanometer-scale colocalization at the IS. Together, our results suggest the balance of NK cell signals, and NK cell responses, are determined by the relative nanoscale colocalization of activating and inhibitory receptors in the immune synapse.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary studies of species coexistence are underpinned by deterministic models that assume that competing species have continuous (i.e. non-integer) densities, live in infinitely large landscapes, and coexist over infinite time horizons. By contrast, in nature species are composed of discrete individuals subject to demographic stochasticity, and occur in habitats of finite size where extinctions occur in finite time. One consequence of these discrepancies is that metrics of species coexistence derived from deterministic theory may be unreliable predictors of the duration of species coexistence in nature. These coexistence metrics include invasion growth rates and niche and fitness differences, which are now commonly applied in theoretical and empirical studies of species coexistence. Here we test the efficacy of deterministic coexistence metrics on the duration of species coexistence in a finite world. We introduce new theoretical and computational methods to estimate coexistence times in stochastic counterparts of classic deterministic models of competition. Importantly, we parameterized this model using experimental field data for 90 pairwise combinations of 18 species of annual plants, allowing us to derive biologically-informed estimates of coexistence times for a natural system. Strikingly, we find that for species expected to deterministically coexist, habitat sizes containing only tens of individuals have predicted coexistence times of greater than 1, 000 years. We also find that invasion growth rates explain 60% of the variation in intrinsic coexistence times, reinforcing their general usefulness in studies of coexistence. However, only by integrating information on both invasion growth rates and species equilibrium population sizes could most (> 99%) of the variation in species coexistence times be explained. This integration is achieved with demographically uncoupled single species models solely determined by the invasion growth rates and equilibrium population sizes. Moreover, because of a complex relationship between niche overlap\/fitness differences and equilibrium population sizes, increasing niche overlap and increasing fitness differences did not always result in decreasing coexistence times as deterministic theory would predict. Nevertheless, our results tend to support the informed use of deterministic theory for understanding the duration of species coexistence, while highlighting the need to incorporate information on species equilibrium population sizes in addition to invasion growth rates.",

      "abstract": "Diel regulation of protein levels and protein modification had been less studied than transcript rhythms. Here, we compare transcriptome data under light-dark cycles to partial proteome and phosphoproteome data, assayed using shotgun mass-spectrometry, from the alga Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living eukaryote. 10% of quantified proteins but two-thirds of phosphoproteins were rhythmic. Mathematical modelling showed that light-stimulated protein synthesis can account for the observed clustering of protein peaks in the daytime. Prompted by night-peaking and apparently dark-stable proteins, we also tested cultures under prolonged darkness, where the proteome changed less than under the diel cycle. The dark-stable, prasinophyte-specific proteins were also reported to accumulate when O. tauri formed lipid droplets. In the phosphoproteome, 39% of rhythmic phospho-sites reached peak levels just before dawn. This anticipatory phosphorylation suggests that a clock-regulated phospho-dawn prepares green cells for daytime functions. Acid-directed and proline-directed protein phosphorylation sites were regulated in antiphase, implicating the clock-related, casein kinases 1 and 2 in phase-specific regulation, alternating with the CMGC protein kinase family. Understanding the dynamic phosphoprotein network should be facilitated by the minimal kinome and proteome of O. tauri.

Tracts of identical amino acids accumulate in these regions and can vary in length over generations due to expansions and retractions of short tandem repeats at the genomic level. However, little attention has been paid to what extent length variation is shaped by natural selection. By environmental association analysis on 2,514 length variable tracts in 770 whole-genome sequenced wild Arabidopsis thaliana we show that length variation in glutamine and asparagine amino acid homopolymers, as well as in interaction hotspots, correlate with local bio-climatic habitat. We determined experimentally that the promoter activity of a light-stress gene depended on polyglutamine length variants in a disordered transcription factor. Our results show that length variations impact protein function and are substantially shaped by natural selection. Length variants modulating protein function at a global genomic scale has implications for understanding protein evolution and eco-evolutionary biology.",

      "abstract": "Cellular aging has been progressively elucidated by science. However, the fundamental cause of senescence--i.e., why organisms age at the multicellular-individual level--remains unclear. A recent theory of individuated multicellularity describes the emergence and growth of crucial information content for cell differentiation. This information is mostly conveyed in the non-epigenetic (i.e., transcription uncorrelated) histone crosstalk near transcription start sites. According to this theory, the non-epigenetic content emerges and grows at the expense of the information capacity for epigenetic content. If this \"reassignment\" of information capacity continues after adulthood, it may explain the senescence phenomenon. Here, I present a novel, falsifiable theory describing an uninterrupted growth of capacity for non-epigenetic information at the expense of that for epigenetic information not only during ontogeny but also throughout adulthood. As a byproduct, this continuous \"reassignment\" of capacity effectively creates an information imbalance in histone crosstalk, which in turn overregulates transcriptional levels. This overregulation is to be understood as transcriptional levels becoming more and more accurate but also less and less precise with respect to the needs of the multicellular individual--up to the point of dysfunctionality. This epigenetic\/non-epigenetic information imbalance is proposed to be the primary reason why individuated multicellular organisms senesce.",

We have obtained evidence supporting our hypothesis that collective properties of the green autofluorescence (AF) of the fingernails and certain skins positions may be a novel diagnostic biomarker for AIS: Both the green AF intensity and AF asymmetry of the AIS patients in their Index Fingernails and most examined skins positions were significantly higher than that of the healthy subjects and the Non-AIS subjects. ROC analyses and machine learning-based analyses on the AF properties showed that AUC was 0.93 and 0.87, respectively, for differentiating the AIS patients from the healthy subjects and for differentiating the AIS patients from the Non-AIS subjects. The AIS patients had significantly higher AF intensity and AF asymmetry at several examined positions, compared to those of the patients of Parkinsons disease, pulmonary infection and transient ischemic attack. The AUC was 0.79 - 0.88 for differentiating AIS patients from each of these diseases. There was evidence suggesting that the AF originates from keratins. Collectively, our study has indicated that the characteristic AISs  Pattern of AF is a novel diagnostic biomarker for the disease. The  Pattern of AF Technology holds excellent potential to become a new non-invasive, label-free and economical diagnostic approach for AIS, which is particularly valuable when MRI or CT imaging resource is deficient.",

This analysis identified subtle morphological differences between samples assessed by the industry as normal and those assessed as abnormal. 50 normal and 50 abnormal samples that were initially categorised using manual assessment to industry standards, were investigated using this new method, with at least 200 fixed stained sperm heads analysed in each case. Differences in sperm nuclear morphology were observed between normal and abnormal samples; specifically, normal samples were associated with higher mean nuclear area, a consequence of a greater head width and a lower variability between sperm heads. This novel, unbiased and fast analysis method demonstrates a significant difference in sperm head morphology between normal and abnormal pig sperm and has the potential to be further developed to be used as a tool for sperm morphology assessment both in the pig breeding industry and potentially in human assisted reproductive technologies.",

Herein, we carried out a microRNA screen to functionally track adult stem cell from human mammary organoids epithelial cell culture. We uncover miR-106a-3p that enrich adult stem cell-like lineage, defined by CD44 and CD24 expression, and promotes organoids expansion. Transcriptomic analysis reveal that this miRNA acts through the regulation of a set of regulators of transcription REST, CBFB and NF-YA, and thus strengthening the adult stem cell maintenance of human mammary epithelial cells. These data demonstrate that organoids can be directly generated from human epithelial cells by only one miRNA: miR-106a-3p.

Here we show that the proteotoxic responsive bacterial protease Lon clears proteins from DNA to promote genotoxic stress resistance. Purified Lon binds DNA and degrades neighboring bound proteins, while a fully active DNA-blind Lon variant does not. This variant can degrade substrates as normal during unstressed growth, complements pleotropic phenotypes of {Delta}lon, including proteotoxic resilience, but remains sensitive to genotoxic stresses and fails to degrade proteins efficiently during DNA damage. Transposon sequencing reveals that {Delta}lon is vulnerable to loss of protein-DNA eviction factors and we use dynamic nucleoid occupancy profiling to show that chromosome-wide protein turnover relies on Lon DNA binding. Finally, disrupting Lon binding to mitochondria genomes also results in genotoxic stress sensitivity, consistent with the bacterial ancestry of this organelle. We propose that clearance of persistent proteins from DNA by Lon originated in free-living -proteobacteria and maintained during the evolution of mitochondria.\n\nSummaryDNA binding by the Lon protease protects against genotoxic damage in a manner preserved from bacteria to mitochondria.",

The lowest p53 levels occur in unstressed cells; however, the functions of these low levels remain unclear. To investigate the functions, we used empirical single-cell tracking of p53-expressing (Control) cells and cells in which p53 expression was silenced by RNA interference (p53 RNAi).

Those results suggest that the low levels of p53 in unstressed cells indeed have a role in suppressing the induction of cell death and the formation of aneuploid cells. We further investigated the impact of p53 silencing by developing an algorithm to simulate the fates of individual cells. Simulation of the fate of aneuploid cells revealed that these cells could propagate to create an aneuploid cell population. In addition, the simulation also revealed that more frequent induction of cell death in p53 RNAi cells under unstressed conditions conferred a disadvantage in terms of population expansion compared with Control cells, resulting in faster expansion of Control cells compared with p53 RNAi cells, leading to Control cells predominating in mixed cell populations. In contrast, the expansion of Control cells, but not p53 RNAi cells, was suppressed when the damage response was induced, allowing p53 RNAi cells to expand their population compared with the Control cells. These results suggest that, although p53 could suppress the formation of aneuploid cells, which could have a role in tumorigenesis, it could also allow the expansion of cells lacking p53 expression when the damage response is induced. p53 may thus play a role in both the suppression and the promotion of malignant cell formation during tumorigenesis.",

We further investigated the impact of p53 silencing by developing an algorithm to simulate the fates of individual cells. Simulation of the fate of aneuploid cells revealed that these cells could propagate to create an aneuploid cell population. In addition, the simulation also revealed that more frequent induction of cell death in p53 RNAi cells under unstressed conditions conferred a disadvantage in terms of population expansion compared with Control cells, resulting in faster expansion of Control cells compared with p53 RNAi cells, leading to Control cells predominating in mixed cell populations. In contrast, the expansion of Control cells, but not p53 RNAi cells, was suppressed when the damage response was induced, allowing p53 RNAi cells to expand their population compared with the Control cells. These results suggest that, although p53 could suppress the formation of aneuploid cells, which could have a role in tumorigenesis, it could also allow the expansion of cells lacking p53 expression when the damage response is induced. p53 may thus play a role in both the suppression and the promotion of malignant cell formation during tumorigenesis.",

The lowest p53 levels occur in unstressed cells; however, the functions of these low levels remain unclear.

Under the first, which we label here the language-centric view, language is central to the syntax-like combinatorial operations of complex reasoning. Under the second, which we label here the language-independent view, these operations are dissociable from the mechanisms of natural language. We applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, to healthy adult participants to transiently inhibit a subregion of Brocas area (BA44) associated in prior work with parsing the syntactic relations of natural language. We similarly inhibited a subregion of dorsomedial frontal cortex (BA8) which has been associated with core features of logical reasoning. There was a significant interaction between task and stimulation site. Post hoc tests revealed that performance on a linguistic reasoning task, but not deductive reasoning task, was significantly impaired after inhibition of BA44, and performance on a deductive reasoning task, but not linguistic reasoning task, was decreased after inhibition of BA8 (however not significantly). Subsequent linear contrasts supported this pattern. These novel results suggest that deductive reasoning may be dissociable from linguistic processes in the adult human brain, consistent with the language-independent view.",

However, reconstruction of flight trajectories in three dimensions typically requires the use of multiple cameras and elaborate calibration procedures. We present an alternative approach that uses a single video camera and a simple calibration procedure for the reconstruction of such trajectories. The technique combines prior knowledge of the wingspan of the bird with a camera calibration procedure that needs to be used only once in the lifetime of the system. The system delivers the exact 3D coordinates of the position of the bird at the time of every full wing extension and uses interpolated height estimates to compute the 3D positions of the bird in the video frames between successive wing extensions. The system is inexpensive, compact and portable, and can be easily deployed in the laboratory as well as the field.",

      "abstract": "Networks underlie much of biology from subcellular to ecological scales. Yet, understanding what experimental data are needed and how to use them for unambiguously identifying the structure of even small networks remains a broad challenge. Here, we integrate a dynamic least squares framework into established modular response analysis (DL-MRA), that specifies sufficient experimental perturbation time course data to robustly infer arbitrary two and three node networks. DL-MRA considers important network properties that current methods often struggle to capture: (i) edge sign and directionality; (ii) cycles with feedback or feedforward loops including self-regulation; (iii) dynamic network behavior; (iv) edges external to the network; and (v) robust performance with experimental noise. We evaluate the performance of and the extent to which the approach applies to cell state transition networks, intracellular signaling networks, and gene regulatory networks. Although signaling networks are often an application of network reconstruction methods, the results suggest that only under quite restricted conditions can they be robustly inferred. For gene regulatory networks, the results suggest that incomplete knockdown is often more informative than full knockout perturbation, which may change experimental strategies for gene regulatory network reconstruction. Overall, the results give a rational basis to experimental data requirements for network reconstruction and can be applied to any such problem where perturbation time course experiments are possible.",

      "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

      "abstract": "Orthologs diverge after lineage separation events and paralogs after gene duplications. Thus, orthologs are expected to remain more functionally coherent across lineages, while paralogs have been proposed as a source of new functions. Because protein functional divergence follows from non-synonymous substitutions, we performed an analysis based on the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN\/dS), as proxy for functional divergence. We used five working definitions of orthology, including reciprocal best hits (RBH), among other definitions based on network analyses and clustering. The results showed that orthologs, by all definitions tested, had values of dN\/dS noticeably lower than those of paralogs, suggesting that, as a group, orthologs tend to be more functionally stable than paralogs. The differences in dN\/dS ratios remained suggesting the functional stability of orthologs after eliminating gene comparisons with potential problems, such as genes with high codon usage biases, low coverage of either of the aligned sequences, or sequences with very high similarities. Separation by percent identity of the encoded proteins showed that the differences between the dN\/dS ratios of orthologs and paralogs were more evident at high sequence identity, less so as identity dropped. While the last results partially explained the differences between dN\/dS ratios of the two groups as being related to differences in protein identity, they also suggested that paralogs undergo functional divergence relatively early after duplication. Our analyses indicate that choosing orthologs as probably functionally coherent remains the right approach in comparative genomics.",

      "abstract": "Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The methods robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.\n\nAuthor summaryCell lineage tree reconstruction carries a significant potential for studies of development and medicine. The lineage tree reconstruction task is especially challenging for cells taken from healthy tissue due to the scarcity of mutations. In addition, the single-cell whole-genome sequencing technology introduces artifacts such as amplification errors, allelic dropouts, and sequencing errors. We propose Scuphr, a probabilistic framework to reconstruct cell lineage trees. We designed Scuphr for single-cell DNA sequencing data; it accounts for technological artifacts in its graphical model and uses germline heterozygous sites to improve its accuracy. Scuphr is embarrassingly parallel; the speed of the computational analysis is inversely proportional to the number of available computational nodes. We demonstrated that Scuphr is fast, robust, and more accurate than the state-of-the-art method with the synthetic data experiments. Moreover, in the biological data experiment, we showed Scuphr successfully identifies different clones and further obtains more support on closely related cells within clones.",

Two novel neural flip-flops (NFFs) are composed of two and four neurons. Their designs follow directly from a standard electronic flip-flop design by moving each negation symbol from one end of the connection to the other. This does not affect the logic of the network, but it changes the logic of each component to a logic function that can be implemented by a single neuron. The flip-flops operation depends only on minimal neuron capabilities of excitation and inhibition. The NFFs can generate known phenomena of short-term memory. Memory tests have shown that certain neurons fire continuously at a high frequency while information is held in short-term memory. These neurons exhibit seven characteristics associated with memory formation, retention, retrieval, termination, and errors. One of the neurons in each of the NFFs produces all of the characteristics. This neuron and a second neighboring neuron together predict eight unknown phenomena. These predictions can be tested by the same methods that led to the discovery of the first seven phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Methane oxidizing microorganisms (methanotrophs) are ubiquitous in the environment and represent a major sink for the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Recent studies have demonstrated that methanotrophs are abundant and contribute to CH4 dynamics in caves. However, very little is known about what controls the distribution and abundance of methanotrophs in subterranean ecosystems. Here, we report a survey of soils collected from > 20 caves in North America to elucidate the factors shaping cave methanotroph communities. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we recovered methanotrophs from nearly all (98 %) of the samples, including cave sites where CH4 concentrations were at or below detection limits ([&le;] 0.3 ppmv). We identified a core methanotroph community among caves that was comprised of high-affinity methanotrophs. Although associated with local-scale mineralogy, methanotroph composition did not systematically vary between the entrances and interior of caves, where CH4 concentrations varied. We also observed that methanotrophs are able to disperse readily between cave systems showing these organisms have low barriers to dispersal. Last, the relative abundance of methanotrophs was positively correlated with cave-air CH4 concentrations suggesting that these microorganisms contribute to CH4 flux in subterranean ecosystems.\n\nIMPORTANCERecent observations have shown that the atmospheric greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is consumed by microorganisms (methanotrophs) in caves at rates comparable to CH4 oxidation in surface soils. Caves are abundant in karst landscapes that comprise 14 % of Earths land surface area, and therefore may represent a potentially important, but overlooked CH4 sink. We sampled cave soils to gain a better understand the community composition and structure of cave methanotrophs. Our results show that the members of the USC-{gamma} clade are dominant in cave communities and can easily disperse through the environment, that methanotroph relative abundance was correlated with local scale mineralogy of soils, and that the relative abundance of methanotrophs was positively correlated with CH4 concentrations in cave air.",

As there is no rodent orthologue of PPP2R3B, we used CRIPSR\/Cas9-mediated gene-editing to generate a series of frameshift mutations in zebrafish ppp2r3b. Adolescent zebrafish that were homozygous for this mutation exhibited a fully penetrant kyphoscoliosis phenotype which became progressively worse over time, mirroring IS in humans.

Paternal trans-generational immune priming (TGIP) was demonstrated in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum: non-infectious bacterial exposure of fathers protects their offspring against an infectious challenge for at least two generations. Epigenetic processes, such as cytosine methylation of nucleic acids, have been proposed to enable transfer of information from fathers to offspring. Here we studied a potential role in TGIP of the Dnmt2 gene (renamed as Trdmt1 in humans), which encodes a highly conserved enzyme that methylates different RNAs, including specific cytosines of a set of tRNAs. Dnmt2 has previously been reported to be involved in intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in mice and protection against viruses in fruit flies. We first studied gene expression and found that Dnmt2 is expressed in various life history stages and tissues of T. castaneum, with high expression in the reproductive organs. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Dnmt2 in fathers was systemic, slowed down offspring larval development and increased mortality of the adult offspring upon bacterial infection. However, these effects were independent of bacterial exposure of the fathers. In conclusion, our results point towards a role of Dnmt2 for paternal effects, while elucidation of the mechanisms behind paternal TGIP needs further studies.",

      "abstract": "We model the evolutionary epidemiology of spore-producing plant pathogens in heterogeneous environments sown with several cultivars carrying quantitative resistances. The model explicitly tracks the infection-age structure and genetic composition of the pathogen population. Each strain is characterized by pathogenicity traits describing its infection efficiency and a time-varying sporulation curve taking into account lesion ageing. We first derive a general expression of the basic reproduction number [R]0 for fungal pathogens in heterogeneous environments. We show that evolutionary attractors of the model coincide with local maxima of [R]0 only if the infection efficiency is the same on all host types. We then study how three basic resistance characteristics (pathogenicity trait targeted, resistance effectiveness, and adaptation cost) in interaction with the deployment strategy (proportion of fields sown with a resistant cultivar) (i) lead to pathogen diversification at equilibrium and (ii) shape the transient dynamics from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives. We show that quantitative resistance impacting only the sporulation curve will always lead to a monomorphic population, while dimorphism (i.e. pathogen diversification) can occur with resistance altering infection efficiency, notably with high adaptation cost and proportion of R cultivar. Accordingly, the choice of quantitative resistance genes operated by plant breeders is a driver of pathogen diversification. From an evolutionary perspective, the emergence time of the evolutionary attractor best adapted to the R cultivar tends to be shorter when the resistance impacts infection efficiency than when it impacts sporulation. In contrast, from an epidemiological perspective, the epidemiological control is always higher when the resistance impacts infection efficiency. This highlights the difficulty of defining deployment strategies of quantitative resistance maximising at the same time epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate. We revealed functions for degenerins\/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.",

      "abstract": "Bicelles have been demonstrated to be a valuable tool for studying membrane protein interactions and structure in vitro. They are distinguished by a distinct lipid bilayer that mimics the plasma membrane of cells making it more native-like than its detergent micelle counter-part. Bicelles are typically comprised of a long-chain phospholipid such as dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and a short-chain phospholipid such as dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC). When mixed together in solution DMPC-DHPC bicelles assume a discoidal structure comprised of a heterogeneous arrangement where the short-chain lipids gather around the rim of the disk and the long-chain lipids form the flat, planar, bilayer region. In this study, the nonionic surfactant, C8E5, was used to prepare mixtures with DMPC to determine if it adopts properties similar to bicelles with a q [&ge;] 0.5. At q [&ge;] 0.5, DMPC-DHPC bicelles are bilayered and DMPC is sequestered from the detergent micelle-like DHPC. Mixtures of DMPC and C8E5 were prepared at various q values, a parameter used to describe the mole ratio of DMPC to DHPC in the preparation of bicelles. Employing biophysical methods like dynamic light scattering, 31P-NMR and analytical ultracentrifugation, properties of these lipid-detergent complexes are described. Interestingly they adopted a spherical-shaped micellar structure morphology and did not assume a discoidal shape typical of bicelles at q [&ge;] 0.5. However, they appear to retain bilayer-like properties that may prove beneficial for in vitro biophysical studies of membrane proteins.",

      "abstract": "Detecting object boundaries is crucial for recognition, but how the process unfolds in visual cortex remains unknown. To study the problem faced by a hypothetical boundary cell, and to predict how cortical circuitry could produce a boundary cell from a population of conventional \"simple cells\", we labeled 30,000 natural image patches and used Bayes rule to help determine how a simple cell should influence a nearby boundary cell depending on its relative offset in receptive field position and orientation. We identified three basic types of cell-cell interactions: rising and falling interactions with a range of slopes and saturation rates, as well as non-monotonic (bump-shaped) interactions with varying modes and amplitudes. Using simple models we show that a ubiquitous cortical circuit motif consisting of direct excitation and indirect inhibition - a compound effect we call \"incitation\" - can produce the entire spectrum of simple cell-boundary cell interactions found in our dataset. Moreover, we show that the synaptic weights that parameterize an incitation circuit can be learned by a single-layer \"delta\" rule. We conclude that incitatory interconnections are a generally useful computing mechanism that the cortex may exploit to help solve difficult natural classification problems.\n\nSignificance statementSimple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) respond to oriented edges, and have long been supposed to detect object boundaries, yet the prevailing model of a simple cell - a divisively normalized linear filter - is a surprisingly poor natural boundary detector. To understand why, we analyzed image statistics on and off object boundaries, allowing us to characterize the neural-style computations needed to perform well at this difficult natural classification task. We show that a simple circuit motif known to exist in V1 is capable of extracting high-quality boundary probability signals from local populations of simple cells. Our findings suggest a new, more general way of conceptualizing cell-cell interconnections in the cortex.",

The environment of the circuits within these regions is largely controlled by glial cells. Studies have shown that, across species, the density of glial cells (number of glial cells per mm3) is the same in the sensory circuits of the neocortex. To test if conserved density might be a principle of glial organization, we examined the paleocortex, which differs from the neocortex in its architecture and computations. We quantified the number of glial cells in the anterior piriform cortex, a paleocortical circuit subserving olfaction, across six mammalian species, using stereology and light microscopy. We found that, like the neocortex, the glial density was constant across species, albeit higher than the neocortex. In conclusion, our findings show a common principle of glial organization, wherein glial densities are the same across species in the neocortex and the paleocortex, though with differing densities between the two regions, likely reflecting local computational demands.",

      "abstract": "Cross-modal plasticity in blind individuals has been reported over the past decades showing that non-visual information is carried and processed by  visual brain structures. However, the structural underpinnings of cross-modal plasticity in congenitally blind individuals remain unclear despite multiple efforts. We mapped thalamocortical connectivity and assessed cortical thickness and integrity of white matter of ten congenitally blind individuals and ten sighted controls. We hypothesized an aberrant thalamocortical pattern of connectivity taking place in the absence of visual stimuli from birth as a potential mechanism of cross-modal plasticity. In addition to the increased cortical thickness of the primary visual cortex and reduced integrity of visual white matter bundles, we observed structural connectivity changes between the thalamus and occipital and temporal cortices. Specifically, the thalamic territory dedicated to connections with the occipital cortex was smaller and displayed weaker connectivity in congenitally blind individuals. In contrast, those connecting with the temporal cortex showed greater volume and increased connectivity compared to sighted controls. The abnormal pattern of thalamocortical connectivity included the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and the pulvinar nucleus. For the first time in humans, a remapping of structural thalamocortical connections involving both unimodal and multimodal thalamic nuclei has been demonstrated, shedding light on the possible mechanisms of cross-modal plasticity in humans. The present findings may help understand the functional adaptations commonly observed in congenitally blind individuals.",

      "abstract": "There is a lack of biomarkers for pre-kidney transplant immune risk stratification to avoid over- or under-immunosuppression, despite substantial advances in kidney transplant management. Since the circulating lipidome is integrally involved in various inflammatory process and pathophysiology of several immune response, we hypothesized that the lipidome may provide biomarkers that are helpful in the prediction of kidney rejection. Serial plasma samples collected over 1-year post-kidney transplant from a prospective, observational cohort of 45 adult Kidney Transplant [antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)=16; stable controls (SC) =29] patients, were assayed for 210 unique lipid metabolites by quantitative mass spectrometry. A stepwise regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) was used to generate models of predictors of rejection and multivariate statistics was used to identify metabolic group differences. The RLDA models include lipids as well as of calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) and presence of significant donor-specific antibody (DSA) at the time of transplant. Analysis of lipids on day of transplant (T1) samples revealed a 7-lipid classifier (lysophosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine species) which discriminated between AMR and SC with a misclassification rate of 8.9% [AUC = 0.95 (95% CI = 0.84-0.98), R2 = 0.63]. A clinical model using cPRA and DSA was inferior and produced a misclassification rate of 15.6% [AUC = 0.82 (95% CI = 0.69-0.93), R2 = 0.41]. A stepwise combined model using 4 lipid classifiers and DSA improved the AUC further to 0.98 (95% CI = 0.89-1.0, R2 = 0.83) with a misclassification of only 2.2%. Specific classes of lipids were lower in AMR compared with SC. Serial analysis of SC patients demonstrated metabolic changes between T1 and 6 months (T2) post-transplant, but not between 6 and 12 (T3) months post-transplant. There were no overtime changes in AMR patients. Analysis of SC T1 vs AMR T3 (that at time of AMR) showed sustained decreased levels of lipids in AMR at the time of rejection. These findings suggest that lack of anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated phospholipids differentiate SC from AMR pre-transplant and at the time of rejection, and a composite model using a 4-lipid classifier along with DSA could be used for prediction of antibody-mediated rejection before transplant.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDespite significant advancements in kidney transplant treatment and intensive clinical follow-up monitoring, all rejection events are unlikely to be recognized at the beginning. As a result, efforts have been made to identify new biomarkers for kidney rejection detection.\nC_LIO_LIWhile lipids are known to be potent mediators of inflammation, pro-resolving processes, and other cell signaling cascades, lipidomics can be applied to identify reliable biomarkers to monitor disease severity and may also allow prediction of kidney rejection.\nC_LIO_LIOur lipidomic study shows lipid profile changes between antibody-mediated rejection group and stable control group as a function of different time point, pre and post-kidney transplantation. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that combining lipid and clinical parameters allow prediction of rejection on the day of the transplant.\nC_LIO_LIThese findings have the potential to change the present paradigm of pre and post-transplant monitoring and management of these patients by implementing an evidence-based risk stratification technique, resulting in a substantial improvement in kidney transplant success.\nC_LI",

      "abstract": "To study how the brain works mechanistically, neuroscientists want to quantify causal interactions between neurons, typically requiring perturbations. When using optogenetic interventions, multiple neurons are usually perturbed which produces a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron making it challenging to discern which of the neurons produced the causal effect. Here we show how such confounds produce large biases, and we explain how they can be reduced by combining instrumental variable (IV) and difference in differences (DiD) techniques from econometrics. The interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period of the neuron produces a weak, approximately random signal which can be exploited to estimate causal transmission probability. On simulated neural networks, we find that estimates using ideas from IV and DiD outperform naive techniques suggesting that methods from causal inference can be useful when studying neural interactions.",

      "abstract": "The role of the visual cortex has been extensively studied to determine its role in object recognition but to a lesser degree to determine how action planning influences the representation of objects features. We used functional MRI and pattern classification methods to determine if during action planning, object features (orientation and location) could be decoded in an action-dependent way. Sixteen human participants used their right dominant hand to perform movements (Align or Open reach) towards one of two 3D-real oriented objects that were simultaneously presented and placed on either side of a fixation cross. While both movements required aiming toward target location, Align but not Open reach movements required participants to precisely adjust hand orientation. Therefore, we hypothesized that if the representation of object features is modulated by the upcoming action, pre-movement activity pattern would allow more accurate dissociation between object features in Align than Open reach tasks. We found such dissociation in the anterior and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in the dorsal premotor cortex, suggesting that visuomotor processing is modulated by the upcoming task. The early visual cortex showed significant decoding accuracy for the dissociation between object features in the Align but not Open reach task. However, there was no significant difference between the decoding accuracy in the two tasks. These results demonstrate that movement-specific preparatory signals modulate object representation in the frontal and parietal cortex, and to a lesser extent in the early visual cortex, likely through feedback functional connections.",

The network, called \"GLEAMS,\" learns to embed spectra into a low-dimensional space in which spectra generated by the same peptide are close to one another. We use GLEAMS as the basis for a large-scale spectrum clustering, detecting groups of unidentified, proximal spectra representing the same peptide, and we show how to use these clusters to explore the dark proteome of repeatedly observed yet consistently unidentified mass spectra. We provide a software implementation of our approach, along with a tool to quickly embed additional spectra using a pre-trained model, to facilitate large-scale analyses.",

      "abstract": "Cells, in order to thrive, make efficient use of metabolites, proteins, energy, membrane space, and time. How, for example, should they allocate the available amount of protein to different metabolic pathways or cell functions? To model metabolic behaviour as an economic problem, some flux analysis model, kinetic models, and cell models apply optimality principles. However, due to their different assumptions these models are hard to compare and combine. Benefits and costs of metabolic pathways - e.g. favouring high production fluxes and low metabolite and enzyme cost - can be derived from general fitness objectives such as fast cell growth. To define pathway objectives, we may assume \"optimistically\" that, given a pathway state, any cell variables outside the pathway will be chosen for maximal fitness. The resulting fitness defines an effective pathway objective as a function of the pathway variables. Here I propose a unified theory that considers kinetic models, describes the set of feasible states as a state manifold and score each state by cost and benefit functions for fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and enzyme levels. To screen the state manifold and to find optimal states, the problem can be projected into flux, metabolite, or enzyme space, where effective cost and benefit functions are used. We reobtain existing modelling approaches such as enzyme cost minimisation or nonlinear versions of Flux Balance Analysis. Due to their common origin, the different approaches share mathematical optimality conditions of the same form. A general theory of optimal metabolic states, as proposed here, provides a logical link between existing modelling approaches and can help justify, interconvert, and combine metabolic optimality problems.",

      "abstract": "To improve their metabolic performance, cells need to find compromises between high metabolic fluxes, low enzyme investments, and well-adapted metabolite concentrations. In mathematical models, such compromises can be described by optimality problems that trade metabolic benefit against enzyme cost. While many such modelling frameworks exist, they are often hard to compare and combine. To unify these modelling approaches, I propose a theory that characterises metabolic systems by a value structure, that is, a pattern of local costs and benefits assigned to all elements in the network. The economic values of metabolites, fluxes, and enzymes are interlinked by local balance equations. Formally defined as shadow values, the economic variables serve as local proxies for benefits that arise anywhere in the network, but are represented as local costs or benefits in the reaction of interest. Here I derive economic variables and their balance equations for kinetic, stoichiometric, and cell models. Metabolic value theory provides a new perspective on biochemical networks, defines concepts for comparing and combining metabolic optimality problems, and is useful for semi-automatic, layered, and modular modelling.",

      "abstract": "Animal development requires coordination among cyclic processes, sequential cell fate specifications, and once-a-lifetime morphogenic events, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. C. elegans undergo four molts at regular 8-10 h intervals. The pace of the cycle is governed by PERIOD\/lin-42 and other as-yet unknown factors. Cessation of the cycle in young adults is controlled by the let-7 family of microRNAs and downstream transcription factors in the heterochronic pathway. Here, we characterize a negative feedback loop between NHR-23, the worm homolog of mammalian retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs), and the let-7 family of microRNAs that regulates both the frequency and finite number of molts. The molting cycle is decelerated in nhr-23 knockdowns, accelerated in let-7(-) mutants, and similar to wild type animals in let-7(-) nhr-23(-) double mutants. NHR-23 binds response elements (ROREs) in the let-7 promoter and activates transcription. In turn, let-7 dampens nhr-23 expression across development via a complementary let-7 binding site (LCS) in the nhr-23 3' UTR. The molecular interactions between NHR-23 and let-7 hold true for other let-7 family microRNAs. Either derepression of nhr-23 transcripts by LCS deletion or high gene dosage of nhr-23 leads to protracted behavioral quiescence and extra molts in adults. NHR-23 and let-7 also co-regulate scores of genes required for execution of the molts, including lin-42. In addition, ROREs and LCSs isolated from mammalian ROR and let-7 genes function in C. elegans, suggesting conservation of this feedback mechanism. We propose that this feedback loop unites the molting timer and the heterochronic gene regulatory network possibly by functioning as a cycle counter.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anxiety\/stressor disorders frequently co-occur and this dual diagnosis represents a major health and economic problem worldwide. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key brain region that is known to contribute to the etiology of both disorders. Although many studies have implicated BLA hyperexcitability in the pathogenesis of AUD and comorbid conditions, relatively little is known about the specific efferent projections from this brain region that contribute to these disorders. Recent optogenetic studies have shown that the BLA sends a strong monosynaptic excitatory projection to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and that this circuit modulates anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. However, it is not known if this pathway influences alcohol drinking-related behaviors. Here, we employed a rodent operant drinking regimen that procedurally separates appetitive (e.g. seeking) and consummatory (e.g. intake) behaviors, chemogenetics, and brain region-specific microinjections, to determine if BLA-vHC circuitry influences alcohol drinking-related measures. We first confirmed prior optogenetic findings that silencing this circuit reduced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus-maze. We then demonstrated that inhibiting the BLA-vHC pathway significantly reduced appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors while having no effect on consummatory measures. Sucrose seeking measures were also reduced following chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit. Taken together, these findings provide the first indication that the BLA-vHC circuit may regulate appetitive alcohol drinking-related behaviors and add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway may contribute to the pathophysiology of AUD and anxiety\/stressor-related disorders.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe basolateral amygdala sends a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection to the ventral hippocampus\nC_LIO_LIInhibiting this circuit reduces anxiety-like behaviors in male Long Evans rats\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of this pathway also decreases operant alcohol seeking-related behaviors\nC_LI",

      "abstract": "CIC encodes a transcriptional repressor and MAPK signalling effector that is inactivated by loss-of-function mutations in several cancer types, consistent with a role as a tumour suppressor. Here, we used bioinformatic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to investigate CICs interaction networks. We observed both previously identified and novel candidate interactions between CIC and SWI\/SNF complex members, and also observed novel interactions between CIC and cell cycle regulators and RNA processing factors. We found that CIC loss is associated with an increased frequency of mitotic defects in human cell lines and an in vivo mouse model and with dysregulated expression of mitotic regulators. We also observed aberrant splicing in CIC-deficient cell lines predominantly at 3 and 5 untranslated regions of genes, including genes involved in MAPK signalling, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation. Our study thus characterises the complexity of CICs functional network and describes the effect of its loss on cell cycle regulation, mitotic integrity, and transcriptional splicing, thereby expanding our understanding of CICs potential roles in cancers. In addition, our work exemplifies how multi-omic, network-based analyses can be used to uncover novel insights into the interconnected functions of pleiotropic genes\/proteins across cellular contexts.\n\nSimple summaryCapicua (CIC) is a gene that is frequently mutated in several cancer types, including stomach cancers and certain subtypes of brain tumours and sarcomas. CIC, the protein encoded by the CIC gene, has been shown to play a multitude of roles in both normal and cancer cell functions; however, most studies exploring these roles focus on a single aspect of CIC function and may therefore overlook complex interconnected activities in which CIC is involved. In this study, we have used multiple complementary approaches to obtain a broader view of CICs complex functional networks. We observed novel interactions (genetic or physical) between CIC and genes\/proteins involved in various aspects of cellular function, including regulation of cell division and processing of RNA molecules. Altogether, our work characterises the complexity of CICs functional network and expands our understanding of its potential roles in cancer.",

Peroxidation of lipids produces reactive dicarbonyls such as Isolevuglandins (IsoLG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) that covalently bind plasma\/cellular proteins, phospholipids, and DNA leading to altered function and toxicity. We examined whether scavenging reactive dicarbonyls with 5-O-pentyl-pyridoxamine (PPM) protects against the development of IR and atherosclerosis in Ldlr-\/- mice.\n\nMethodsMale or female Ldlr-\/- mice were fed a western diet (WD) for 16 weeks and treated with PPM versus vehicle alone. Plaque extent, dicarbonyl-lysyl adducts, efferocytosis, apoptosis, macrophage inflammation, and necrotic area were measured. Plasma MDA-LDL adducts and the in vivo and in vitro effects of PPM on the ability of HDL to reduce macrophage cholesterol were measured. Blood Ly6Chi monocytes and ex vivo 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation into bone marrow CD11b+ monocytes and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) were also examined. IR was examined by measuring fasting glucose\/insulin levels and tolerance to insulin\/glucose challenge.\n\nResultsPPM reduced the proximal aortic atherosclerosis by 48% and by 46% in female and male Ldlr-\/- mice, respectively. PPM also decreased IR and hepatic fat and inflammation in male Ldlr-\/- mice. Importantly, PPM decreased plasma MDA-LDL adducts and prevented the accumulation of plaque MDA- and IsoLG-lysyl adducts in Ldlr-\/- mice. In addition, PPM increased the net cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL from Ldlr-\/- mice and prevented both the in vitro impairment of HDL net cholesterol efflux capacity and apoAI crosslinking by MPO generated hypochlorous acid. Moreover, PPM decreased features of plaque instability including decreased proinflammatory M1-like macrophages, IL-1{beta} expression, myeloperoxidase, apoptosis, and necrotic core. In contrast, PPM increased M2-like macrophages, Tregs, fibrous cap thickness, and efferocytosis. Furthermore, PPM reduced inflammatory monocytosis as evidenced by decreased blood Ly6Chi monocytes and proliferation of bone marrow monocytes and HSPC from Ldlr-\/- mice.\n\nConclusionsPPM has pleotropic atheroprotective effects in a murine model of familial hypercholesterolemia, supporting the therapeutic potential of reactive dicarbonyl scavenging in the treatment of IR and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Animal migration is highly sensitised to environmental cues, but plant dispersal is considered largely passive. The common dandelion, Taraxacum officinale, bears an intricate haired pappus facilitating flight. The pappus enables the formation of a separated vortex ring during flight; however, the pappus structure is not static but reversibly changes shape by closing in response to moisture. We hypothesised that this leads to changed dispersal properties in response to environmental conditions. Using wind tunnel experiments for flow visualisation, particle image velocimetry, and flight tests we characterised the fluid mechanics effects of the pappus morphing. We also modelled dispersal to understand the impact of pappus morphing on diaspore distribution. Pappus morphing dramatically alters the fluid mechanics of diaspore flight. We found that when the pappus closes in moist conditions, the drag coefficient decreases and thus the falling velocity is greatly increased. Detachment of diaspores from the parent plant also substantially decreases. The change in detachment when the pappus closes increases dispersal distances by reducing diaspore release when wind speeds are low. We propose that moisture-dependent pappus-morphing is a form of informed dispersal allowing rapid responses to changing conditions.",

In maize, above-ground roots, called brace roots, have been shown to reduce root lodging susceptibility. However, the underlying structural-functional properties of brace roots that prevent root lodging are poorly defined. In this study, we quantified structural mechanical properties, geometry, and bending moduli for brace roots from different whorls, genotypes, and reproductive stages. Using 3-point bend tests, we show that brace root mechanics are variable by whorl, genotype, and reproductive stage. Generally, we find that within each genotype and reproductive stage, the brace roots from the whorl closest to the ground had higher structural mechanical properties and a lower bending modulus than brace roots from the second whorl. There was additional variation between genotypes and reproductive stages. Specifically, genotypes with higher structural mechanical properties also had a higher bending modulus, and senesced brace roots had lower structural mechanical properties than hydrated brace roots. Collectively these results highlight the importance of considering whorl-of-origin, genotype, and reproductive stage for quantification of brace root mechanics, which is important for mitigating crop loss due to root mechanical failure.",

Using an excisional wound and genetic mouse models of wound healing, we discovered that Caspase-1, a protein classically known as an integral component of the cytosolic inflammasome, is secreted and has a non-canonical role in the extracellular milieu.

PR3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (PR3-ANCAs) recognize different epitopes on PR3. We aimed to study the effect of mutations on PR3 antigenicity.\n\nMethodsThe recombinant PR3 variants, iPR3 which is clinically used to detect PR3-ANCAs and iHm5 which contains three point mutations in Epitope 1 and 5 generated for epitope mapping studies, immunoassays and serum samples from patients enrolled in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) clinical trials were used to screen the differential PR3-ANCA binding. Selective binding was determined by inhibition experiments.\n\nResultsRather than a reduced binding of PR3-ANCAs to iHm5, we found substantially increased binding of the majority of PR3-ANCAs to iHm5 compared with iPR3. A monoclonal ANCA (moANCA518) from a patient with GPA was found to selectively bind to iHm5 within the mutation-free Epitope 3 and distant from the point mutations of iHm5 contained in Epitope 1 and 5. Binding of iPR3 to monoclonal antibody MCPR3-2 also induced recognition by moANCA518.\n\nConclusionThe preferential binding of PR3-ANCAs from patients like the selective binding of moANCA518 to iHm5 is conferred by increased antigenicity of Epitope 3 on iHm5. This can also be induced on iPR3 when it is captured by monoclonal antibody MCPR-2. This previously unrecognized characteristic of PR3-ANCA interactions with its target antigen has implications for studying antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, understanding of variable performance characteristics of immunoassays and design of potential novel treatment approaches.",

We identify optimal culture media for maintaining neoblasts in vitro, and show via transplantation that cultured stem cells retain pluripotency for two days. We developed a new procedure that significantly improves neoblast yield and purity by modifying standard flow cytometry methods. These methods enable the introduction and expression of exogenous mRNAs in neoblasts, overcoming a key hurdle impeding the application of transgenics in planarians.

      "abstract": "While organ-confined PCa is mostly therapeutically manageable, metastatic progression of PCa remains an unmet clinical challenge. Resistance to anoikis, a form of cell death initiated by cell detachment from the surrounding extracellular matrix, is one of the cellular processes critical for PCa progression towards aggressive disease. Therefore, further understanding of anoikis regulation in PCa might provide therapeutic opportunities. Here, we discover that PCa tumors with concomitantly compromised function of two tumor suppressor phosphatases, PP2A and PTEN, are particularly aggressive, having less than 50% 5-year secondary-therapy free patient survival. Functionally, overexpression of PME-1, a PP2A inhibitor protein, inhibits anoikis in PTEN-deficient PCa cells. In vivo, PME-1 inhibition increased apoptosis in in ovo PCa tumor xenografts, and attenuated PCa cell survival in zebrafish circulation. Molecularly, PME-1 deficient PCa cells display increased trimethylation at lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), a phenotype corresponding to increased apoptosis sensitivity. In summary, we discover that PME-1 overexpression supports anoikis resistance in PTEN-deficient PCa cells. Clinically, the results identify PME-1 as a candidate biomarker for a subset of particularly aggressive PTEN-deficient PCa.",

We present a computational model that incorporates experimental genome structures and protein mobility dynamics to mechanistically describe the stochastic foundations of DNA replication. Analysis of about 300,000 in silico profiles for fission yeast indicates that the number of firing factors is rate-limiting and dominates completion time. Incorporating probabilistic activation and binding, a full-genome duplication was achieved with at least 300 firing factors, with the only assumption that factors get recycled upon replication fork collision. Spatial patterns of replication timing were reproduced only when firing factors were explicitly activated proximally to the spindle pole body. Independent in vivo experiments corroborate that the spindle pole body acts as a replication activator, driving origin firing. Our model provides a framework to realistically simulate full-genome DNA replication and investigate the effects of nuclear architecture.",

      "abstract": "Metagenomics is increasingly used to describe microbial communities in biological specimens. Ideally, the steps involved in the processing of the biological specimens should not change the microbiome composition in a way that it could lead to false interpretations of inferred microbial community composition. Common steps in sample preparation include sample collection, storage, DNA isolation, library preparation, and DNA sequencing. Here we assess the effect of three library preparation kits and two DNA sequencing platforms. Of the library preparation kits, one involved a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step (Nextera), and two were PCR-free (NEXTflex and KAPA). We sequenced the libraries on Illumina HiSeq and NextSeq platforms. As example microbiomes, we assessed two pig fecal samples and two sewage samples of which aliquots were stored at different storage conditions (immediate processing and storage at -80{degrees}C). All DNA isolations were performed in duplicate, totaling 80 samples excluding controls. We found that both library preparation and sequencing platform had systematic effects on the inferred microbial community composition. The different sequencing platforms introduced more variation than library preparation and freezing the samples. The results highlight that all sample processing steps need to be considered when comparing studies. Standardization of sample processing is key to generate comparable data within a study, and comparisons of differently generated data, such as in a meta-analysis, should be performed cautiously.\n\nImportancePrevious research has reported effects of sample storage conditions and DNA isolation procedures on metagenomics-based microbiome composition; however, the effect of library preparation and DNA sequencing in metagenomics has not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we provide evidence that library preparation and sequencing platform introduce systematic biases in the metagenomic-based characterization of microbial communities. These findings suggest that library preparation and sequencing are important parameters to keep consistent when aiming to detect small changes in microbiome community structure. Overall, we recommend that all samples in a microbiome study are processed in the same way to limit unwanted variations that could lead to false conclusions. Furthermore, if we are to obtain a more holistic insight from microbiome data generated around the world, we will need to provide more detailed sample metadata, including information about the different sample processing procedures, together with the DNA sequencing data at the public repositories.",

      "abstract": "Transport of proteins across and into membranes is a fundamental biological process with the vast majority being conducted by the ubiquitous Sec machinery. In bacteria, this is usually achieved when the SecY-complex engages the cytosolic ATPase SecA (secretion) or translating ribosomes (insertion). Great strides have been made towards understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. Yet, important questions remain - notably, the nature of the individual steps that constitute transport, and how the proton-motive force (PMF) across the plasma membrane contributes. Here, we apply a recently developed high-resolution protein transport assay to explore these questions. We find that pre-protein transport is limited primarily by the diffusion of arginine residues across the membrane, particularly in the context of bulky hydrophobic sequences. This specific effect of arginine, caused by its positive charge, is mitigated for lysine which can be deprotonated and transported across the membrane in its neutral form. These observations have interesting implications for the mechanism of protein secretion, suggesting a simple mechanism by which PMF can aid transport, and enabling a  proton ratchet, wherein re-protonation of exiting lysine residues prevents channel re-entry, biasing transport in the outward direction.",

This multi-task approach allowed assessing the developmental trajectory and interplay of several aspects of motor control related to different coordinative requirements. Children were first able to symmetrically move the two hands, and only later to coordinate one hand with a proprioceptive or visual signal.

      "abstract": "The SIR complex (Silent Information Regulator) is the building block of heterochromatic structures that silence underlying genes. It is well established that the silenced state is epigenetically inherited but it is not known how the SIR complex survives perturbations caused by DNA replication nor how it is maintained when cells are exposed to environmental challenges such as nutrient deprivation. The biological function of heterochromatin located in subtelomeric regions is also unclear since heterochromatin coverage appears to be limited to a few kbps near chromosome ends and the expression of subtelomeric genes is only marginally affected in the absence of the SIR complex. We use a three pronged approach to address these questions. First, nanopore-MetID, an in vivo foot printing technique similar to DamID that uses nanopore sequencing technology, identified hundreds of new transient contacts between Sir3 and euchromatic genes that are not detectable by ChIP-seq and revealed a high and a previously undocumented low-density mode of Sir3 binding to subtelomeric regions. Second, our measurements of genome-wide Sir3 exchange rates after exit from starvation show that heterochromatin is a highly dynamic structure in optimal growth conditions. Third, \"spike-in\" RNA-seq time course experiments in the same conditions reveal that Sir3 modulates global mRNA levels in correlation with fluctuations in nutrient availability. We now propose that subtelomeric regions serve as Sir3 hubs from which Sir3 diffuses down the chromosome arm and transiently contacts euchromatic genes in its path. We hypothesize that contacts between Sir3 and actively transcribed genes facilitate the removal of stalled transcription complexes and allow for optimal genome-wide transcription.",

      "abstract": "The microbiota populating the rhizosphere, the interface between roots and soil, can modulate plant growth, development and health. These microbial communities are not stochastically assembled from the surrounding soil but their composition and putative function are controlled, at least partially, by the host plant. Here we use the staple cereal barley as a model to gain novel insights into the impact of differential applications of nitrogen, a rate-limiting step for global crop production, on the host genetic control of the rhizosphere microbiota. Using a high-throughput amplicon sequencing survey, we determined that nitrogen availability for plant uptake is a factor promoting the selective enrichment of individual taxa in the rhizosphere of wild and domesticated barley genotypes. Shotgun sequencing and metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that this taxonomic diversification is mirrored by a functional specialisation, manifested by the differential enrichment of multiple GO-terms, of the microbiota of plants exposed to nitrogen conditions limiting barley growth. Finally, a plant soil feedback experiment revealed that the host control on the barley microbiota underpins the assembly of a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria putatively required to sustain plant performance under nitrogen-limiting supplies. Taken together, our observations indicate that under nitrogen conditions limiting plant growth, plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions fine-tune the host genetic selection of the barley microbiota at both taxonomic and functional levels. The disruption of these recruitment cues negatively impacts plant growth.\n\nImportanceThe microbiota inhabiting the rhizosphere, the thin layer of soil surrounding plant roots, can promote the growth, development, and health of their host plants. Previous research indicated that differences in the genetic composition of the host plant coincide with differences in the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota. This is particularly evident when looking at the microbiota associated to input-demanding modern cultivated varieties and their wild relatives, which have evolved under marginal conditions. However, the functional significance of these differences remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the rhizosphere microbiota of wild and cultivated genotypes of the global crop barley and determined that nutrient conditions limiting plant growth amplify the host control on microbes at the root-soil interface. This is reflected in a plant- and genotype-dependent functional specialisation of the rhizosphere microbiota which appears required for optimal plant growth. These findings provide novel insights into the significance of the rhizosphere microbiota for plant growth and sustainable agriculture",

      "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focussed search libraries based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing will only target the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. We describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation, and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines.\n\nResultsWe compared MetaNovo to published results from the MetaPro-IQ pipeline on 8 human mucosal-luminal interface samples, with comparable numbers of peptide and protein identifications, many shared peptide sequences and a similar bacterial taxonomic distribution compared to that found using a matched metagenome database - but simultaneously identified many more non-bacterial peptides than the previous approaches. MetaNovo was also benchmarked on samples of known microbial composition against matched metagenomic and whole genomic database workflows, yielding many more MS\/MS identifications for the expected taxa, with improved taxonomic representation, while also highlighting previously described genome sequencing quality concerns for one of the organisms, and identifying a known sample contaminant without prior expectation.\n\nConclusionsBy estimating taxonomic and peptide level information directly on microbiome samples from tandem mass spectrometry data, MetaNovo enables the simultaneous identification of peptides from all domains of life in metaproteome samples, bypassing the need for curated sequence search databases. We show that the MetaNovo approach to mass spectrometry metaproteomics is more accurate than current gold standard approaches of tailored or matched genomic database searches, can identify sample contaminants without prior expectation and yields insights into previously unidentified metaproteomic signals, building on the potential for complex mass spectrometry metaproteomic data to speak for itself.

      "abstract": "Diffraction-unlimited single-molecule techniques like STORM and (F)PALM enable three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging at tens of nanometer resolution and are invaluable to investigate sub-cellular organization. The multitude of camera frames required to reconstruct a super-resolved image limits the typical throughput of these techniques to tens of cells per day, rendering these methods incompatible with large-scale cell biological or clinical application. STORM acquisition rates can be increased by over an order of magnitude, however the data volumes of about 40 TB a day and concomitant analysis burdens exceed the capacity of existing workflows. Here we present an integrated platform which transforms SMLM from a trick-pony technique into a work horse for cell biology. We leverage our developments in microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage, and distributed analysis to automatically perform real-time localization analysis, which enable SMLM at throughputs of 10,000 cells a day. We implemented these advances in a fully-integrated environment that supports a highly-flexible architecture for distributed analysis, enabling quickly- and graphically-reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition, remotely executed, and even feedback and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable for hardware control on custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework so users can readily extend all components of their imaging, visualization, and analysis pipeline. PYME is cross-platform, open source, and efficiently puts high-caliber visualization and analysis tools into the hands of both microscope developers and users.",

      "abstract": "Enoyl-CoA carboxylases\/reductases (ECRs) belong to the most efficient CO2-fixing enzymes described to date. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ECRs extraordinary catalytic activity on the level of the protein assembly remain elusive. Here we used a combination of ambient temperature X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) and cryogenic synchrotron experiments to study the structural organization of the ECR from Kitasatospora setae. K. setae ECR is a homo-tetramer that differentiates into a dimer of dimers of open- and closed-form subunits in the catalytically active state. Using molecular dynamics simulations and structure-based mutagenesis, we show that catalysis is synchronized in K. setae ECR across the pair of two dimers. This conformational coupling of catalytic domains is conferred by individual amino acids to achieve high CO2-fixation rates. Our results provide unprecedented insights into the dynamic organization and synchronized inter- and intra-subunit communications of this remarkably efficient CO2-fixing enzyme during catalysis.\n\nSignificance StatementFixation of CO2 offers real potential for reaching negative CO2 emissions in bioenergy, and bioproduct utilization. The capture and conversion of atmospheric CO2 remains a challenging task. Existing biological systems can be exploited and optimized for this use. Bacterial enoyl-CoA carboxylases\/reductases (ECRs) encompass the fastest CO2-fixing enzymes found in nature to date. However, the mechanisms underlying ECRs extraordinary catalytic activity remain elusive. Our structural, computational, and biochemical results elucidate the dynamic structural organization of the ECR complex and describe how coupled motions of catalytic domains in the ECR tetramer drive carboxylation. This mechanistic understanding is critical for engineering highly efficient CO2-fixing biocatalysts for bioenergy and bioproduct applications.",

      "abstract": "Aging in postmitotic tissues is associated with clonal expansion of somatic mitochondrial deletions, the origin of which is not well understood. Deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are often flanked by direct nucleotide repeats, but this alone does not fully explain their distribution. Here, we hypothesized that the close proximity of direct repeats on single-stranded DNA might play a role in the formation of deletions. By analyzing human mtDNA deletions in the major arc of mtDNA, which is single-stranded during replication and is characterized by a high number of deletions, we found a non-uniform distribution with a \"hot spot\" where one deletion breakpoint occurred within the region of 6-9kb and another within 13-16kb of the mtDNA. This distribution was not explained by the presence of direct repeats, suggesting that other factors, such as the spatial proximity of these two regions can be the cause. In silico analyses revealed that the single-stranded major arc may be organized as a large-scale hairpin-like loop with a center close to 11kb and contacting regions between 6-9 kb and 13-16 kb, which would explain the high deletion activity in this contact zone. The direct repeats located within the contact zone, such as the well-known common repeat with a first arm at 8470-8482 bp and a second arm at 13447-13459 bp, are three times more likely to cause deletions compared to direct repeats located outside of the contact zone. An analysis of age- and disease-associated deletions demonstrated that the contact zone plays a crucial role in explaining the age-associated deletions, emphasizing its importance in the rate of healthy aging. Overall, we provide topological insights into the mechanism of age-associated deletion formation in human mtDNA, which could be used to predict somatic deletion burden and maximum lifespan in different human haplogroups and mammalian species.",

Earlier work has predicted that physiological adaptation to climate change will be accompanied by a shift in temperature preferences, but empirical evidence for this is lacking. Here, we test whether exposure to different thermal environments has led to changes in preferred temperatures in the wild. Our study takes advantage of a  natural experiment in Iceland, where freshwater populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are found in waters warmed by geothermal activity year-round (warm habitats), adjacent to populations in ambient-temperature lakes (cold habitats). We used a shuttle-box approach to measure temperature preferences of wild-caught sticklebacks from three warm-cold population pairs. Our prediction was that fish from warm habitats would prefer higher water temperatures than those from cold habitats. We found no support for this, as fish from both warm and cold habitats had an average preferred temperature of 13{degrees}C. Thus, our results challenge the assumption that there will be a shift in ectotherm temperature preferences in response to climate change. In addition, since warm-habitat fish can persist at relatively high temperatures despite a lower temperature preference, this suggests that preferred temperature alone may be a poor indicator of a populations adaptive potential to a novel thermal environment.",

Synaptic competition is known to facilitate synapse elimination; however, it has remained unknown how different synapses compete to each other within a postsynaptic cell. Here we investigate how a mitral cell in the olfactory bulb prunes all but one primary dendrite during the developmental remodeling process. We find that spontaneous activity generated within the olfactory bulb is essential. We show that strong glutamatergic inputs to one dendrite trigger branch-specific changes in RhoA activity to facilitate the pruning of the remaining dendrites: NMDAR-dependent local signals suppress RhoA to protect it from pruning; however, the subsequent neuronal depolarization induces neuron-wide activation of RhoA to prune non-protected dendrites. NMDAR-RhoA signals are also essential for the synaptic competition in the barrel cortex. Our results demonstrate a general principle whereby activity-dependent lateral inhibition across synapses establishes a discrete receptive field of a neuron.",
